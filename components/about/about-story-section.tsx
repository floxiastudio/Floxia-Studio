Our founders, with deep backgrounds in software engineering, UI/UX design, and digital marketing, saw an opportunity to do things differently.",

We built multi-platform e-commerce systems, integrated AI tools before they became mainstream, and designed brand identities that genuinely reflected each client's voice and vision. Word spread. Our client roster grew. And Floxia Studio evolved from a small but mighty team into a full-service web development powerhouse.",
              "Today, we partner with businesses of all sizes from funded startups and local service providers to national retail brands and global e-commerce operations. Our portfolio spans dozens of industries and hundreds of successful website launches. But regardless of the project size, our commitment remains the same: deliver extraordinary work, on time, every time.",
